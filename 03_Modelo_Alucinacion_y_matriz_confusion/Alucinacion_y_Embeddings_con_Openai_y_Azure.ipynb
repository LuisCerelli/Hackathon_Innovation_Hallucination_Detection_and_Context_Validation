INTRODUCTION\\nHow does the climate affect society and the economy? This question has challenged thinkers for\\ncenturies, and the answer promises insight into why economies developed differently historically,\\nhow modern society can best respond to current climatic events, and how future climate changesmay impact humanity. In recent years, numerous econometric analyses have emerged to address\\nthis question by studying the effects of speciﬁc climatic conditions on different social and economic\\noutcomes. The recency of this research activity is explained primarily by methodological advances\\nthat, combined with increasing access to computing power and climate data, catalyzed progress.\\nThe goal of this review is to collect and synthesize these advances. In particular, I highlight core\\ninnovations and explain linkages between different methods. I also attempt to tackle an issue that\\nhas proved particularly thorny: the debate as to whether regressions on “weather” variables provide\\nmeaningful insight into the effects of climate. By formalizing this question, I can derive conditionsunder which the use of weather variables in regressions is justiﬁed and, perhaps surprisingly,\\ndominates traditionally preferred methods. In the latter portion of this review, I discuss how these\\nnew econometric results are being used to understand other scientiﬁc or policy questions, suchas the optimal design of climate change policy. Throughout, I draw attention to methodological\\nchallenges that remain unsolved.\\nThis review focuses on methodology, so I will not describe data or results that are not examples\\nof methodological innovations. I encourage readers to consult Auffhammer et al. (2013) for a\\ndiscussion of climate data in general and other review articles surveying ﬁndings from this rapidly\\ngrowing ﬁeld; for example, those regarding health impacts (Desch ˆenes 2014), agricultural impacts\\n(Auffhammer & Schlenker 2014), energy impacts (Auffhammer & Mansur 2014), conﬂict impacts\\n(Burke et al. 2015b), climatic disaster impacts broadly speaking (Kousky 2014) and tropical cyclones\\nspeciﬁcally (Camargo & Hsiang 2016), labor impacts (Heal & Park 2015), and a general summary\\nof ﬁndings from across the literature (Carleton & Hsiang 2016, Dell et al. 2014).\\n1.1. Deﬁning Climate\\nHere I develop a formal deﬁnition for the climate that is ﬂexible, general, and encompasses usages\\nthroughout the literature.\\nFor any position in space i, there exists a vector of random variables at each moment in time t\\ncharacterizing the conditions of the atmosphere and ocean that are relevant to economic conditions\\nati. Heuristically, one could imagine this random vector as\\nvit=/bracketleftbig\\ntemperature it,precipitationit,humidityit,.../bracketrightbig\\n. (1)\\nFor an interval in time τ=[t,¯t)a ti, there exists a joint probability distribution ψ(Ciτ)f r o mw h i c h\\nwe imagine vitis drawn:\\nvit∼ψ(Ciτ)∀t∈τ. (2)\\nCiτis a vector of Krelevant parameters—ideally sufﬁcient statistics—indexed by kthat character-\\nizes distributions in the ψ(.) family of distributions, such as location and shape parameters. Deﬁne\\nCiτto be the climate at iduring τ, as it characterizes the distribution of possible realized states vit.\\nFor each period τ, there is an empirical distribution ψ(ciτ) that characterizes the distribution\\nof states vi,t∈τthat are actually realized. In many contexts, some of the Kparameters in ciτhave\\nanalogs to ﬁtted values for a model where the distribution is constrained to the ψ(.) family, but\\n44 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nsuch an analogy is imperfect because ciτare actual measurements, not estimates.1Note that ciτ\\nandCiτare vectors of the same length with analogous elements, but they are not the same. Ciτ\\ncharacterizes the expected distribution of vit, whereas ciτcharacterizes the realized distribution\\nofvi,t∈τ. Thus, we deﬁne ciτto be a description of the weather during τ.\\nExamples help clarify how these deﬁnitions of climate and weather differ. Consider that the\\nweather measures ciτmight contain the sample mean and sample standard deviation of daily\\nrainfall during a month, whereas the corresponding Ciτwould contain the true population mean\\nand true population standard deviation of rainfall that could occur during that period. In another\\nexample, ciτcould contain the maximum sustained wind gust speed actually experienced during\\na 24-h interval, whereas Ciτcontains the maximum of the true theoretical gust distribution for\\nthat day. Finally, ciτcould contain the count of realized days with average temperatures below\\nfreezing or above 30◦C in a year, whereas Ciτmight then contain the expected number of days in\\nthese categories.\\nFor notational simplicity, deﬁne c(C) as a realization of weather characteristics cconditional\\non climate characteristics C.\\nTwo questions immediately emerge for an applied econometrician. First, how should the\\njoint distribution ψ(C) for the high dimensional vector vbe summarized? Are we concerned\\nonly with average values and variances or also with some other summary statistics, such as timebeyond a critical value (e.g., extreme heat days) or events that involve multiple dimensions of v\\n(e.g., wind and rain simultaneously)? Unfortunately, at present, no exhaustive list of summary\\nstatistics or dimensions of vfully describes all socially and economically relevant parameters.\\nIn practice, different researchers have explored whether and how different summary measures c\\nmatter by examining one or a few at a time; for example, they examine average temperatures whencontrolling for average rainfall, but these should be understood as rough characterizations of a\\nmore highly structured multidimensional distribution. As current research progresses, the set of\\nknown relevant summary parameters generally tends to grow.\\nSecond, how long of a time interval τshould be considered? Historically, climate was sometimes\\ndeﬁned as an average over 30 years (Pachauri et al. 2014), but this deﬁnition is fairly arbitrary. In re-\\nality, there exists a well-deﬁned expected distribution of states that might occur even for very shortperiods of time. For example, at every location there is an expected distribution of temperatures\\nthat might occur for each 5-min interval on each day of the year. Furthermore, this distribution\\nmight change between consecutive years, for example, due to the El Ni ˜no-Southern Oscillation\\n(ENSO). This suggests that climate need not have a fundamental timescale and econometricians\\nmay, in principle, study periods of varying lengths of time.\\n1.2. Inﬂuence of Climate Through Events and Information\\nThe climate affects social outcomes in two ways. First, the climate during τinﬂuences what\\nrealizations of weather cactually occur during that interval, which in turn affects a population\\ndirectly (e.g., a rainy climate generates rain, causing people to get wet); call this the direct effect of\\n1It is possible that some researchers may attempt to construct empirical estimates of ˆCiτusing data that resemble or are\\nidentical to measurements ciτ, but this need not always be the case. For example, an estimate for the population mean of\\ndaily temperatures during a year, a climate parameter, happens to equal the sample mean of daily temperatures, a weatherparameter. But weather parameters need not always have the same form as estimators for climate parameters, and climateparameters, describing an abstract population distribution that is never actually observed, need not depend on weather.\\nWeather parameters should always be interpreted as measurements associated with individual observations. In principle,\\nclimate parameters could be formulated in the absence of real world measurements, for example, based on a theoretical ornumerical model of the climate.\\nwww.annualreviews.org\\n•Climate Econometrics 45 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nclimate. Second, individuals’ beliefs over the structure of Cmay affect their decisions and resulting\\noutcomes, regardless of what cis realized (e.g., if people believe their climate is rainy, some will\\nbuy umbrellas); refer to this as the belief effect. Denote all actions resulting from beliefs as the\\nvector bof length N, indexed by n. We can then write that an outcome is affected by the climate\\nbecause the climate affects what weather is realized and what actions individuals take based ontheir beliefs about the climate:\\nY(C)=Y[c(C),b(C)]. (3)\\nTherefore, the total marginal effect of the climate on outcome Yis characterized by the K-element\\nvector of derivatives\\ndY(C)\\ndC=∇ cY(C)·dc\\ndC+∇ bY(C)·db\\ndC\\n=K/summationdisplay\\nk=1∂Y(C)\\n∂ckdck\\ndC\\n/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright\\ndirect effects+N/summationdisplay\\nn=1∂Y(C)\\n∂bndbn\\ndC\\n/bracehtipupleft /bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft /bracehtipupright\\nbelief effects, (4)\\nwhere ∇cand∇bare deﬁned as gradients in the subspaces of candb, respectively.2Observe that\\ndc\\ndCanddb\\ndCareK×Kand N×KJacobians.3\\nNote that all partial derivatives are evaluated “locally” at the current climate C.

THE EMPIRICAL PROBLEM\\nWe are interested in identifying the effect of the climate on a population or economy, holding allother factors ﬁxed. Denoting the vector of observable nonclimatic factors xthat affect outcome\\nY, we can express the average treatment effect βfor a change in climate /Delta1C\\niτas\\nβ=E[Yiτ|Ciτ+/Delta1Ciτ,xiτ]−E[Yiτ|Ciτ,xiτ]. (5)\\nInference is challenging because βcan never be observed directly, as the single population ican\\nnever be exposed to both counterfactuals CandC+/Delta1Cfor the exact same interval of time τ.\\nThis is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference (Holland 1986).\\nIn an ideal experiment aimed at recovering β, we would locate two sample populations ( iand\\nj) that are identical in every way and experimentally manipulate the climate of ito be Cand the\\n2Deﬁne ∇cY=[∂Y\\n∂c1,...,∂Y\\n∂cK]a n d∇bY=[∂Y\\n∂b1,...,∂Y\\n∂bN],which can be concatenated to form the complete gradient vector\\n∇Y=[∇cY,∇bY].\\n3The Jacobian matrices aredc\\ndC=⎡\\n⎢⎢⎢⎣∂c1\\n∂C1···∂c1\\n∂CK\\n.........\\n∂cK\\n∂C1···∂cK\\n∂CK⎤\\n⎥⎥⎥⎦and db\\ndC=⎡\\n⎢⎢⎢⎣∂b1\\n∂C1···∂b1\\n∂CK\\n.........\\n∂bN\\n∂C1···∂bN\\n∂CK⎤\\n⎥⎥⎥⎦.\\n46 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nclimate of jto be C+/Delta1C.

Note that the right-hand term is not observed.

(7)\\nUnfortunately, such an experiment is usually impossible for most large-scale settings of interest,\\nalthough some laboratory experiments have applied a randomized version of this approach in psy-\\nchology (Mackworth 1946), ergonomics (Seppanen et al. 2006), sports medicine (Nybo & Secher2004), and military research (Hocking et al. 2001). In these settings, where /Delta1Ccan be randomly\\nassigned and experimentally manipulated (e.g., warming a room), application of Equation 7 is suf-\\nﬁcient for inference. In all other cases, the econometrician requires a research design that deliversan approximation of Equation 5.\\n2.1. Research Designs\\nThere are essentially three research designs in use that approximate the average treatment effectin Equation 5: cross-sectional approaches, use of time-series variation, and a hybrid known as longdifferences. The conceptual trade-offs to these designs center around ( a) whether it is reasonable\\nto assume that distinct populations are comparable units after the econometrician has conditioned\\non observable characteristics, and ( b) whether climatic events observed to affect a population are\\nsufﬁcient to capture relevant direct effects and belief effects of climate.\\n2.1.1. Cross-sectional approaches. In cross-sectional research designs, different populations in\\nthe same period τare compared to one another after conditioning on observables x\\niτ.T h ec o r e\\nassumption needed for this approach is the unit homogeneity assumption as written in Equation 6.\\nUnder this assumption, if different populations have the same climate, then their expected con-ditional outcomes are assumed to be the same. This allows the econometrician to attribute all\\ndifferences in observed conditional outcomes to differences in climate, by estimating Equation 7\\nhaving assumed Equation 6. In a linear framework, this estimate is usually implemented via a\\nregression equation of the form\\nY\\ni=ˆα+CiˆβCS+xiˆγ+ˆ/epsilon1i, (8)\\nwhere τsubscripts are omitted because all observations occur in the same period. Here, ˆαis a\\nconstant, ˆγare effects of observables, and ˆ/epsilon1iare unexplained variations. The estimate of interest ˆβCS\\nis a column vector of coefﬁcients describing marginal effects of terms in Ci, the set of parameters4\\nselected by the econometrician to characterize the probability distribution of vat each location i.\\nThis design was used widely in early econometric analyses of the effect of the climate\\n(Fankhauser 1995, Tol 2009), gaining prominence in the seminal work by Mendelsohn et al.\\n(1994) who regressed farm prices across US counties on growing season temperatures and ob-servable characteristics of farm properties. This implementation highlights a major strength of\\nthis approach in the context of climatic effects: Because farmers who inhabit a location for a long\\n4Note that in practice, econometricians must estimate ˆCfrom data, which is often implemented by estimating moments of\\nψusing historical data describing v. In principle, Cneed not be estimated from real world data; for example, it could be\\nconstructed using a theoretical or numerical climate model.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 47 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nperiod will have a strong grasp of Cat their location and will adjust farm investments and man-\\nagement to optimize based on these beliefs, farm prices can be assumed to reﬂect all direct effectsand all belief effects. An additional beneﬁt of the cross-sectional research design is that it can be\\nenriched by imposing additional structure on the model and still remain tractable, as in work by\\nCostinot et al. (2016) and Desmet & Rossi-Hansberg (2015), who consider the effect of climateon the spatial allocation of production, labor, and trade.\\nA weakness of the cross-sectional approach is its vulnerability to omitted variables bias. When\\nvariables that affect Y\\niare not included in either Ciorxibut are correlated with one of their\\nelements, the resulting estimates will be biased (Wooldridge 2002). The surmountability of this\\nproblem may be limited because Equation 6 is untestable, i.e., there exists no systematic methodfor determining whether any key variables are omitted from Equation 8. Thus, econometricians\\ncan never be certain their model is unbiased.\\nOne approach designed to address the concern of omitted variables bias is to saturate the model\\nwith as many variables as possible. For example, Nordhaus (2006) developed a novel 1\\n◦×1◦\\ngridded global data set of economic production and numerous geographic and climatic factors,\\nwhich was then applied to Equation 8 at the pixel level to estimate the effect of temperature oneconomic productivity. Another approach to constrain the inﬂuence of omitted variables is to limit\\nthe subsamples of observations for which Equation 6 is assumed by only comparing populations\\nthat are thought to have similar unobservable characteristics. For example, Albouy et al. (2010)estimate the effect of temperature on housing prices across the United States. They focus on\\nwithin-locality comparisons because many characteristics that distinguish localities are difﬁcult to\\nparametrize for inclusion in Equation 8 but are likely correlated with climatic differences acrosslocalities and would thus bias ˆβ\\nCSin a fully pooled regression.\\nIt is not possible to determine if all important variables have been included in Equation 8,\\nalthough in some sectors where the data generating process is well known, such as maize yields\\nin the United States (Schlenker 2010), an accumulation of studies may provide us with modest\\nconﬁdence that most important factors are accounted for. Yet in other cases, such as civil wars(Burke et al. 2015b), it is generally assumed that a comprehensive suite of important nonclimatic\\nfactors may never be known, imposing a ceiling on the assurance we can achieve when using the\\ncross-sectional research design for these outcomes.\\n2.1.2. Identiﬁcation in time series. An alternative approach to approximating Equation 5,\\ninstead of assuming that populations iandjare comparable, is to examine only population iacross\\nseparate periods (indexed by τ) when different environmental conditions are realized at i.T h i s\\napproach conditions outcomes on c\\niτ, where each observation summarizes a joint distribution\\nof many vectors vitobserved during the period τ. An advantage of this approach is that it relies\\non a plausibly weaker form of the unit homogeneity assumption because it only requires that anindividual population iis comparable to itself across moments in time. However, this approach\\ncan only approximate Equation 5 by introducing a second assumption that I call the marginal\\ntreatment comparability assumption :\\nE[Y\\ni|cτ]−E[Yi|C1]=E[Yi|C1+(cτ−C1)/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright\\n/Delta1C]−E[Yi|C1]=E[Yi|C2]−E[Yi|C1], (9)\\nwhere C2=C1+/Delta1C. This assumption states that the change in expected outcomes between a\\nperiod where cτis realized relative to outcomes conditioned on a benchmark climate C1is the\\nsame as the change in expected outcomes if the distribution characterized by C1were distorted\\nby adjustments to climate parameters by /Delta1C(deﬁned as the difference between the realized\\nmeasures cτand the climate values C1) to create a new distribution characterized by C2(Figure 1 ).\\n48 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\n–15 –10 –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 >30\\nDaily temperatures (˚C)aIdentifying variation\\nfrom a small changein daily temperaturedistribution during τ\\nC1C1cτ\\ncτ – C1 C2 – C1b\\nd c\\n–15 –10 –5 0 5 10 15 20 25 >30\\nDaily temperatures (˚C)\\nFigure 1\\nIllustration of the marginal treatment comparability assumption, adapted from Deryugina & Hsiang (2014).

The marginal treatment\\ncomparability assumption states that the effect of the change in the weather distribution in panel dis the same as the effect of the change\\nin the climate distribution in panel c.\\nIn other words, marginal treatment comparability assumes that the effect of a marginal change\\nin the distribution of weather (relative to expectation) is the same as the effect of an analogous\\nmarginal change in the climate. Because this assumption has been widely debated, in the followingsubsections I propose a partial test of this assumption and derive some conditions under which it\\nholds exactly.\\nIn a linear framework, this approach is usually implemented using either time-series or panel\\ndata via a regression equation of the form\\nY\\niτ=ˆαi+ciτˆβTS+xiτˆγ+ˆθ(i)(τ)+ˆ/epsilon1i, (10)\\nwhere ˆαiare unit-speciﬁc ﬁxed effects that absorb the effect of all time-invariant factors that differ\\nbetween units, including unobservables that could not be accounted for in the cross-sectional\\nresearch design. ˆθ(i)(τ) are trends in the outcome data, often accounted for using period ﬁxed\\neffects and/or linear or polynomial time trends, which may be region or unit speciﬁc.\\nThis approach was probably ﬁrst proposed by Huntington (1922, p. 14) who argued, “The ideal\\nway to determine the effect of climate would be to take a given group of people and measure their\\nactivity daily for a long period, ﬁrst in one climate, and then in another,” and implemented analogs\\nto Equation 10 using factory worker data. This approach gained prominence in modern economic\\nanalysis when used by Desch ˆenes & Greenstone (2007), who analyzed whether agricultural proﬁts\\nin US counties responded to “random ﬂuctuations in weather.”\\nThe core beneﬁt of this approach is that it accounts for unobservable differences between\\nunits, eliminating a potential source of omitted variables bias. However, this approach still remainsvulnerable to omitted variables bias if there are important time-varying factors that inﬂuence the\\noutcome and are correlated over time with c\\niτorxiτafter conditioning on trends θ(i)(τ). It is usually\\nassumed that variations in ciτover time are exogenous to changes in social and economic changes\\nbecause they are driven by stochastic geophysical processes. However, Hsiang (2010) points out\\nthat many dimensions of ciτare correlated over time because they are partially driven by the same\\nprocesses—e.g., temperature, rainfall, and hurricanes are all modulated by ENSO—so ˆβTSmay be\\nbiased if important climatic variables are omitted. A separate concern raised by Auffhammer et al.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 49 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\n(2013) and Hsiang et al. (2015) is that weather data might not be orthogonal to socioeconomic\\nconditions because weather reporting is endogenous. The extent to which these two issues affectthe literature as a whole remains unknown.\\nSome authors introduce time-varying nonclimatic factors as controls in Equation 10, such as\\ncrop prices or avoidance behavior. However, Hsiang et al. (2013) caution that this may introducenew biases if these factors are endogenous and affected by climatic events, a situation known as\\nbad control (Angrist & Pischke 2008).\\nA special case of the time-series research design are cohort analyses, such as those conducted\\nby Maccini & Yang (2009) who examined the long-term effects of rainfall during childhood\\namong girls in Indonesia. In these implementations, sequential cohorts within a location iare\\nassumed to be comparable to one another conditional on x\\niτ, differing only in their exposure to\\nsequential realizations of ciτ. This represents a strengthening of the unit homogeneity assumption,\\nas sequential cohorts within iare different populations that are assumed to be comparable.\\n2.1.3. A hybrid approach: long differences. An approach that aims to compromise between\\nthe strengths and weaknesses of cross-sectional analysis and time-series identiﬁcation is the long-differences strategy, in which changes for both the outcome and the climate within locations\\nare correlated across locations. The long-differences strategy is a cross-sectional comparison of\\nchanges over time, which for two periods of observation {τ\\n1,τ2}is implemented with the regression\\nYiτ2−Yiτ1=ˆα+(ciτ2−ciτ1)ˆβLD+(xiτ2−xiτ1)ˆγ+ˆ/epsilon1i, (11)\\nwhere ˆαrepresents the secular change in Yover time, and ˆβLDrepresents the extent to which\\ntrends in climate are correlated across space with trends in Y. This approach is known as “long”\\ndifferences because it is primarily used to test whether gradual changes in cinduce gradual changes\\ninY,s oτ1andτ2are usually chosen to be two periods far apart in time. When long differences\\nhas been implemented to measure the effects of climate on growth (Dell et al. 2012), crop yields\\n(Burke & Emerick 2016, Lobell & Asner 2003), and conﬂict (Burke et al. 2015b), authors havefound that β\\nLDis almost identical to βTS, leading them to conclude that gradual changes in clikely\\ninduce similar effects to more rapid changes in c.\\nThe beneﬁt of using long differences, relative to time-series analyses that use short differences,\\nis that the marginal treatment comparability assumption in Equation 9 might be more plausibly\\nsatisﬁed because changes in care gradual—although a weakness of this approach relative to pure\\ncross section is that some form of this assumption is still required. The beneﬁt of this approachrelative to pure cross-sectional analyses is that it requires a weaker form of the unit homogeneity\\nassumption, where only changes in Yare assumed to be comparable across units rather than\\nrequiring levels of Yto be comparable. But this assumption remains stronger than the weak\\nwithin-unit homogeneity assumption required for time-series identiﬁcation. This tension between\\nthe marginal treatment comparability assumption and the unit homogeneity assumption is an\\noverarching challenge to research design in this literature, as discussed below.\\n2.2. The Trade-Off Between Low-Frequency Variations\\nand Credible Identiﬁcation\\nThe extent to which Equation 10 identiﬁes direct effects and belief effects of the climate is often\\nthought to depend on the lengths of periods over which the distribution ψ(ciτ) is summarized,\\nthat is ¯t−t. Because belief effects are caused by agents responding to the belief that they face\\na probability distribution of outcomes described by Ciτ, the extent to which these effects are\\ncaptured by Equation 10 likely depends on an agent’s belief that changes in the distribution of\\n50 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nrealized measures ciτreﬂect changes in the prior probability of those events occurring. It is widely\\nassumed that agents facing events vitfor long τwill update their beliefs over Ciτ, whereas agents\\nexperiencing events during a short period—perhaps only for a 5-min period—will not alter their\\nbeliefs over Ciτfor that interval. Thus, individuals might experience the direct effects of climatic\\nevents during short τ, but they may be unlikely to alter their beliefs about the climate they face\\nbecause of a short-lived event.\\nBecause of this logic, it is widely thought that low-frequency data (long /Delta1τ=τ2−τ1=¯t−t\\nfor regularly spaced data) are required to measure belief effects when using time-series variation,\\nas populations only adjust their beliefs if environmental changes are persistent. In the limit that\\nfrequencies of ciτexploited by the econometrician approach zero (i.e., the length of /Delta1τapproaches\\ninﬁnity), the research design actually approaches the pure cross-sectional analysis in Equation 8.\\nThus, the motivation to exploit low-frequency data in time-series designs mirrors the motivation of\\ncross-sectional analysis, as those data are thought to capture both the direct effects and belief effectsof climate changes. Early examples of this approach are Zhang et al. (2007) and Tol & Wagner\\n(2010), both of whom apply a low-pass ﬁlter to climatic variables before estimating Equation 10.\\nA related alternative approach is to use climate data sampled at a low frequency, as implementedby Bai & Kung (2011), who count droughts over each decade to form each observation in a\\nmillennial-scale time series.\\nAlthough exploiting low-frequency variations in cis appealing because such an approach might\\ncapture both direct and belief effects, it comes at the cost of less credible identiﬁcation, an issue\\nhighlighted by Hsiang & Burke (2014, p. 2) as the “frequency-identiﬁcation trade-off.” The unit\\nhomogeneity assumption for time series identiﬁcation is\\nE[Y\\niτ|C,xiτ]=E[Yi,τ+/Delta1τ|C,xi,τ+/Delta1τ], (12)\\nwhere units of observation are assumed to be comparable across periods of observation. How-\\never, as the frequency (1 //Delta1τ) of observation becomes lower, the assumption that Yiτand Yi,τ+/Delta1τ\\nare comparable becomes increasingly difﬁcult to justify. For example, populations separated by\\nmultiple centuries might not be comparable units.\\nThe tension between credible identiﬁcation and use of low-frequency climate variation is not\\neasily resolved if populations do not update their beliefs about the climate more quickly thanthese populations naturally change in other fundamental ways. For cases in which belief effects are\\nlarge relative to direct effects, then the frequency-identiﬁcation trade-off may represent a major\\nchallenge to credible identiﬁcation of the total effect of the climate. Importantly, however, if theprimary way in which belief effects manifest is to alter the direct effects of the climate—i.e., belief\\neffects are mostly adaptations designed to cope with direct effects—then the total effects of climate\\nstill may be nearly identiﬁed with high-frequency time series. Even when this condition is notsatisﬁed, exact identiﬁcation may still be possible, as shown in Section 2.4.\\n2.3. A Partial Test of Marginal Treatment Comparability\\nUnit homogeneity assumptions can be weakened but never tested or eliminated entirely, a funda-mental limitation in causal inference generally. However, it may be possible to implement a partial\\ntest of the marginal treatment comparability assumption by comparing whether estimated effects\\nare similar when using approaches that exploit climatic variations at different temporal frequencies.Ifˆβ\\nCS=ˆβLD=ˆβTS, i.e., if the effects of high-frequency changes equal the effects estimated with\\nlong differences and in cross section, then one possible explanation is that the marginal treatment\\ncomparability assumption is valid, and temporary changes in realizations of chave similar effects to\\nanalogous changes in C. This could be true if the sum of all belief effects is small on net. Versions\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 51 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nof these different comparisons were implemented and discussed in Burke & Emerick (2016), Burke\\net al. (2015b), Dell et al. (2009), Hsiang & Jina (2015), Lobell & Asner (2003), and Schlenker &Roberts (2009), in which any differences in estimated effects were attributed to adaptations to\\nclimate, i.e., belief effects that interact with direct effects. However, a known difﬁculty is that the\\nstrength of this test relies directly on the validity of the different unit homogeneity assumptionsused in each of the models compared. It is theoretically possible to obtain ˆβ\\nCS=ˆβLD=ˆβTSby\\nchance even if all key assumptions are violated, so long as biases have countervailing effects.\\nBuilding on these earlier partial tests, I propose that the credibility of this approach can be\\nfurther strengthened by estimating climate effects using a spectrum of data that has been ﬁltered at\\nall different temporal frequencies. If the estimated effect of changes in cis stable across all temporal\\nfrequencies spanning from unﬁltered time-series data to long differences and the zero-frequency\\ncross section, then it seems less plausible that omitted variables biases at different frequencies\\nare exactly offsetting belief effects and more plausible that the marginal treatment comparabilityassumption is valid. The idea for this test comes from the observation that a time series of the kth\\nelement of the vector ccan be decomposed into the Fourier series\\nc\\nkτ=ak\\n0+∞/summationdisplay\\nω=1/bracketleftbig\\nak\\nωsin(ωτ)+bk\\nωcos(ωτ)/bracketrightbig\\n, (13)\\nwhere ak\\nωand bk\\nωare constants representing projections onto the basis functions sine and cosine\\nat varying frequencies ω,a n d ak\\n0is a constant, analogous to a long-run average (i.e., ω=0).\\nOutcome data Ycan be similarly decomposed. If we can ﬁnd appropriate ﬁlters that allow us to\\nisolate only certain frequency bands [ ω,¯ω], then we can estimate Equation 10 using these ﬁltered\\ndata and obtain ˆβ[ω,¯ω]\\nTS, the estimated relationship between climate variables and an outcome at\\neach timescale. As timescales become longer (and frequencies become lower), this estimate should\\ncontinuously approach the long-differences estimate and eventually the cross-sectional estimateif the marginal treatment comparability assumption is valid and these estimates are unbiased.\\nTo demonstrate this test, I obtained panel data on annual county-level maize yield, temperature,\\nand rainfall used in Schlenker & Roberts (2009), updated to the year 2014 and restricted to the 730counties east of the 100th meridian that had no missing observations. I then applied a Baxter-King\\napproximate band-pass ﬁlter (Baxter & King 1999) to all three variables for various frequencies and\\nestimated Equation 10 with each set of ﬁltered data. Figure 2 shows the effect of temperature on\\nyields at these various timescales overlaid with estimates of ˆβ\\nTSas in Schlenker & Roberts (2009),\\nˆβLDas in Burke & Emerick (2016), and ˆβCSas in Schlenker et al. (2006). In all cases, except the cross\\nsection, these estimated effects are near one another and not statistically different, suggesting thatvariations in temperature over time have similar effects on maize yields in this context, regardless of\\nthe timescale of these variations. The uniqueness of the cross-sectional estimate could be explained\\neither by belief effects that emerge only at timescales longer than 33 years (the longest timescaleof the ﬁltered data) or omitted variables bias—although the fact that ˆβ\\nCSchanges substantially\\n(to more closely resemble time-series estimates) when rainfall terms are omitted highlights the\\nvulnerability of the cross-sectional approach to misspeciﬁcation.

Such critiques, relying on heuristic arguments, are common in\\nthe literature. Nonetheless, there is actual theoretical justiﬁcation for the marginal treatment\\ncomparability assumption. In this section I provide a new derivation demonstrating how, under\\ncertain conditions, the total effect of climate can be exactly recovered using ˆβTSderived from\\nweather variation. In essence, this result is a combined application of two well-known results, the\\nEnvelope Theorem and the Gradient Theorem.\\nThe intuition of the result is as follows. Imagine there are two otherwise identical households\\nthat are next-door neighbors on a street that runs north–south. The more northern household\\nfaces a very slightly different climate because it is very slightly further north. The difference in\\nclimate faced by the two households is vanishingly small, but nonzero. These two householdshave the ability to adapt many dimensions of their daily life to their beliefs about their respective\\nclimates, and they will adopt slightly different behaviors and investments that maximize various\\noutcomes, generating belief effects. However, if we focus on outcomes that are maximized by thehouseholds, then the overall net effect caused by these slightly different adaptation decisions is zero\\nbecause any marginal beneﬁts that the northern household reaps are exactly offset by additional\\nmarginal costs (which is known because the household is at a maximum). Therefore, any differencein the optimized outcome between the two households must come from the direct effects of the\\nslightly different climate, and the inﬂuence of slightly different beliefs and adaptations between the\\ntwo households can be ignored. If a weather realization occurs such that the southern household\\nexperiences conditions that are slightly different from what they expect, and its distribution of\\nweather actually matches the climate of the northern household, then this weather effect on the\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 53 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\noptimized outcome of the southern household must be exactly the same as the cross-sectional dif-\\nference across the two households in a year when their weather realizations match their respectiveclimates perfectly. This is because in both cases, there is no inﬂuence of changing beliefs on the\\noptimized outcome. Stated simply, the marginal effect of the climate on an optimized outcome is\\nexactly the same as the marginal effect of the weather.\\nBased on this insight, we can trace out a curve describing climate effects between sequential\\nneighbors by watching how optimized outcomes in each household change when that household\\nis confronted by a weather distribution that matches the climate of their immediate next-door\\nneighbor. The integral of these marginal differences between sequential neighbors must then\\ndescribe how the climate generates larger differences between households that are not adjacentneighbors and how they experience climates that differ by a nonmarginal amount. Importantly,\\nthis integration procedure does not assume that individuals do not adjust their beliefs and adapt\\nto their climate. Rather, the marginal effect of such adjustments for marginal climate changesis zero on an optimized outcome, so marginal effects of weather—which do not cause beliefs to\\nchange—can be used as a substitute for marginal climate changes in the integration, despite the\\npresence of changing beliefs and adaptations.\\nTo see this result formally, consider an outcome of interest Ythat may be affected by the\\nclimate Cthrough its effect on weather realizations cand actions band which is optimized so it\\ncan be written as a value function, i.e., the solution to a maximization problem over an outcome-generating function z(b,c). If we assume zis differentiable and concave in b, there will be a unique\\noptimum b\\n∗(C) for each climate:\\nY(C)=Y[b∗(C),c(C)]=max\\nb∈RNz[b,c(C)]. (14)\\nRecall that the notation c(C) means weather realization cgenerated from climate C. Note that\\nmaximization of zis allowed to occur through some indirect process, such as efﬁcient market al-\\nlocations, and need not result from explicit maximization by agents. Figure 3 aplots the outcome\\nsurface zfor an example case in which C,c,a n d beach have only one dimension.

For cross-sectional regressions to recover the effect of ConYin this context, we require all of the above\\nassumptions as well as the additional assumption that integration constants are identical:\\ndφ\\ndi=0, (24)\\nwhich implies the strong form of the unit homogeneity assumption that units are comparable in\\nlevels conditional on the climate (Equation 6). Thus, the set of assumptions necessary for valid\\ncross-sectional identiﬁcation in this setting is strictly larger than the set of assumptions required\\nfor valid time-series identiﬁcation.\\nTo my knowledge, the above result has not been previously established, and as such, existing\\nempirical papers leveraging weather variation do not explicitly check the assumptions critical\\nto this result: that Yis the solution to a (constrained) maximization, that adaptations btake on\\ncontinuous values, and that the maximand function z(.) is differentiable in b. Further, many prior\\nstudies do not properly compute climate effects via Equation 23, with the notable exception of\\nSchlenker et al. (2013) and Houser et al. (2015), who essentially implement a form of this approachexplicitly. Total effects of climatic changes in Equation 23 are also computed correctly in studies\\nwhere marginal effects of weather are allowed to change based on underlying climatic conditions.\\nThese evolving marginal weather effects are integrated to compute the cost of shifting climaticconditions, as in Hsiang & Narita (2012) and Burke et al. (2015c). Finally, those studies in which\\nthe marginal effects of weather are approximately invariant in climate, such as Ranson (2014) and\\nDeryugina & Hsiang (2014), also basically estimate Equation 23 when they linearly extrapolateweather effects because the two calculations are equivalent.\\n3. MEASUREMENT OF CLIMATE VARIABLES\\nThe measurement of climate variables is a critical methodological step in identifying climateeffects, regardless of the research design used. Early analyses concerned only with measuringwhether climatic factors had a nonzero effect, or the sign of an effect, used simple measures\\nof climate such as latitude or a single indicator variable that is one if a population is exposed\\nto a predeﬁned event (e.g., a drought) and is zero otherwise. This approach is internally validbut has important limitations that are often underappreciated in the literature. First, coarse\\nclimate measures introduce large measurement errors that will cause attenuation bias, leading to\\nunder-rejection of the null hypothesis. Second, the structure of a dose-response function\\nE[Y|c]=f(c) (25)\\nis often of interest. For example, we may be interested in nonlinearities or whether multiple\\ndimensions of climate interact in important ways, requiring that measures of climate variablesbe near continuous and multidimensional. Third, if measures of cdo not reﬂect scalable physical\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 57 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nquantities in the real world, we may have little conﬁdence that estimated effects are externally\\nvalid to other locations or to periods when the climate may change. For example, it is impossibleto consider how cyclone intensiﬁcation may affect outcomes if cyclone exposure is measured only\\nas a binary variable. Fourth, pooling a sample of different locations may provide a valid average\\ntreatment effect of climatic conditions on the sample, but it may be a poor predictor of outcomesat any actual locations if the physical properties of events coded as similar are not actually\\nphysically similar. Finally, the result derived in the previous section, that time-series variations\\ncan be used to exactly identify marginal effects of the climate, can only hold if climatic variations\\nare measured in such a way that an econometrician can identify marginal effects. For example,\\nbinary treatments are not differentiable, and so it may be difﬁcult to determine if changing fromno treatment to treatment is a marginal change.\\nFor all of the above reasons, many of the major innovations covered in the literature over the\\npast decade have resulted from improvements in the measurement of climate variables, contribut-ing at least as much to recent advances, if not more, than functional form innovations (discussed\\nin Section 4). For example, using spatial interpolation techniques, Schlenker & Roberts (2009)\\ndeveloped estimates of temperature with high spatial and temporal resolution, which allowedthem to construct precise measures of degree-days that integrate cumulative exposure to speciﬁc\\ntemperature ranges ( Figure 4 a). Desch ˆenes & Greenstone (2011) introduced a related approach\\nin which days are counted based on their average temperature [see Deryugina & Hsiang (2014)for a derivation of this approach]. Yang (2008) estimated the effect of tropical cyclones by cod-\\ning a storm’s maximum windspeed at landfall, an approach enriched further by Nordhaus (2010)\\nand Mendelsohn et al. (2012) who used additional landfall statistics; Hsiang (2010) expandedthe measurement of cyclone exposure by integrating wind speed exposure at all points through-\\nout the lifetime of a storm ( Figure 4 b). Guiteras et al. (2015) implemented a novel technique\\nfor detecting surface ﬂooding using satellite imagery. Auffhammer et al. (2006) used an atmo-\\nspheric circulation model to estimate overhead aerosol exposure. Hsiang et al. (2011) developed\\na method to identify the ENSO exposure of countries ( Figure 4 c). Fishman (2016) utilized sev-\\neral metrics to characterize the evenness of rainfall distributions that are similar in total rainfall\\n(Figure 4 d). In several cases, researchers ﬁnd that established linear or nonlinear transforma-\\ntions of fundamental climatic measures, such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity, are useful inexplaining patterns of outcomes, such as the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index\\n(Harari & La Ferrara 2013), drought indices (Couttenier & Soubeyran 2014), vapor pressure\\ndeﬁcit (Urban et al. 2015), heat indices (Baylis 2015), or malaria ecology indices (McCord 2016).In all cases, these various measures can be understood as approaches to collapsing the dimen-\\nsionality of cin a manner that efﬁciently describes patterns that matter from an economic or\\nsocial standpoint. In most of these cases, alternative approaches to measuring climate variablescannot be viewed as objectively wrong; rather there are many ways of describing data in cthat\\ndo not efﬁciently describe those components of variation that most strongly inﬂuence the out-\\ncomes of interest. Blunt climate measures are not wrong, they just introduce large measurementerrors.\\nParticular caution is needed when applying the natural logarithm transformation standard in\\nmany economic applications to climate measures, as it is not always sensible. For example, using\\nlog(temperature ) in Equation 10 is challenging to interpret because a 1% change in temperature—\\nused in the interpretation of the resulting coefﬁcients—has a different meaning depending onwhether temperature is measured in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin. In other cases, such trans-\\nformed data can be ﬁt to a model, but the standard interpretation is inconsistent with physical\\nphenomena. For example, Nordhaus (2010) and Mendelsohn et al. (2012) model hurricane dam-age using log( windspeed ) and conclude that damage is superelastic because it appears to grow up to\\n58 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\n29°C\\nmm mm\\n100200\\n0Daily rainfall in Ahmedabad, Gujarat\\n0 50 100 150 2000100200\\nDays (May 1st–Nov 1st)1996\\nTotal rainfall: 642 mmRainy days: 77\\n2000\\nTotal rainfall: 635 mm\\nRainy days: 47\\nMeters per second0204060\\nKilometers\\neastKilometers\\nnorthMeters per second40\\n20\\n0\\n200\\n–2000\\n0\\n–200200\\nTeleconnected\\nlocationsTemperature\\nTime24 h 24 hDegree days >29°CTotal wind speed\\n at surfaceTmax\\nTmax\\nTmin Tmin Tminab\\ncd\\nFigure 4\\nExamples of innovations in climate measurement.

Future innovations will further\\nimprove our understanding of these climate effects substantially.\\n4. ECONOMETRIC MODELS\\nHaving selected a research design and constructed appropriate climate measures, an econometri-\\ncian must select a model that is ﬁtted to the data. Here I discuss ﬁve aspects of modeling that have\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 59 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nbeen particularly important in the measurement of climate effects: nonlinearities, displacement,\\nuncertainty, adaptation, and cross-study comparisons.\\nThe discussion here is focused on the measurement of climate effects by applying a reduced\\nform approach to construct a dose-response surface. Such an approach does not necessarily specify\\na single pathway through which the climate affects social outcomes, and in many cases it is likelythat several pathways play a role. Hsiang et al. (2013) suggest that to reject potential pathways in\\nany given context, researchers must look for natural experiments in which a particular pathway is\\nobstructed due to external factors and then examine whether reduced form effects persist; studies\\nby Sarsons (2015) and Fetzer (2014) are useful examples of this strategy.\\nIt is worth noting that a large number of studies in economics utilize variation in weather\\nas an instrumental variable to study the effect of an intermediary variable on an outcome. This\\nstrategy relies on the assumption of an exclusion restriction, i.e., that the employed weather\\nvariation only affects the outcome through the speciﬁed intermediary variable. This assumption isuntestable, although the large number of studies utilizing exogenous variation in weather to study\\na large number of outcomes through various proposed pathways seems to be evidence that this\\nassumption cannot be true in many cases.\\n4.1. Nonlinear Effects\\nThe interpretation and estimation of nonlinear effects depend heavily on whether observations\\nare highly resolved in space and time or whether they are highly aggregated. Because weather\\ndata are often available at high resolution, even when outcome data are not, it is often possibleto recover microlevel response functions, below the level of aggregation in the outcome data, by\\ncarefully considering the data generating process.\\n4.1.1. Recovering local, microlevel, and instantaneous nonlinear effects. Local effects of\\nclimatic variables are often nonlinear in important ways, such as extreme cold days and extreme heat\\ndays generating excess mortality (Desch ˆenes & Greenstone 2011) or extreme heat hours causing\\ndamage to crop yields (Schlenker & Roberts 2009). In some cases, such as Aroonruengsawat &\\nAuffhammer (2011) and Graff Zivin & Neidell (2014), outcomes are measured at the same dailyfrequency as these nonlinear effects manifest, rendering their measurement straightforward using\\nstandard techniques. However, in most cases nonlinear effects manifest over timescales (e.g., hours)\\nand spatial scales (e.g., pixels) that are much ﬁner than the periodicity and spatial scale at whichoutcome data are measured (e.g., annually by country). Similarly, local effects may differ between\\nmultiple locations within a unit of observation. Despite aggregation of the outcome across space\\nand over moments in time, it is possible to recover nonlinear relationships at the spatial andtemporal scale at which climatic data are recorded. Suppose outcome Y\\niτis observed over regions\\ni(e.g., provinces) made up of more ﬁnely resolved positions s(e.g., pixels) during intervals of time\\nτ(e.g., years) comprised of shorter moments t(e.g., days). Let the instantaneous nonlinear effect\\nof climate at a moment and position be f(cst), which we approximate as a linear combination of\\nMsimple nonlinear functions (e.g., polynomial terms)\\nf(cst)≈β1f1(cst)+β2f2(cst)+...+βMfM(cst)=M/summationdisplay\\nm=1βmfm(cst), (26)\\nwhere the βs are constant coefﬁcients. In practice, f(.) has been successfully modeled as an\\nM-piecewise linear function, as in degree-day models; an Mth order polynomial or restricted\\ncubic spline (Miller et al. 2008, Schlenker & Roberts 2009); interactions between multiple climatemeasures (Urban et al. 2015), options which have efﬁciency and (local) differentiability beneﬁts;\\n60 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nor an M-piecewise constant or “binned” function (Deryugina & Hsiang 2014, Desch ˆenes & Green-\\nstone 2011), a ﬂexible nonparametric option.\\nUnder the assumption of temporal and spatial separability, i.e., that the outcome of interest is\\na linear sum of f(.) across positions and moments, weighted by the number of affected economic\\nunits gs(e.g., crop ﬁelds) at those positions, then the regressions in Equations 8, 10, and 11 are\\nmodiﬁed to the form\\nYiτ=αi+/bracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\\ns∈i/summationdisplay\\nt∈τf(cst)gs/bracketrightBigg\\n+xiτγ+θ(i)(τ)+/epsilon1iτ, (27)\\nwhere the index and functions of τand region effects αiare omitted in the cross-sectional case.\\nNotably, as demonstrated in Welch et al.

Nonlinearity in regional summary measures due to local nonlinearities.

Equation 31 differs from Equation 29 such that the two approaches\\nshould not recover identical coefﬁcients, even if the microlevel nonlinear data generating process\\nis unchanged. Burke et al. (2015c) demonstrate that the marginal effects recovered in Equation 31should equal the weighted-average marginal effect at the local level (as estimated in Equation 29),\\naveraged across locations and moments, that is associated with a one-unit shift in the distribution\\nof local climatic conditions ( Figure 5 ). Importantly, it is the spatial covariance between weights g\\ns\\nand climatic conditions within periods of observation that determines how local nonlinear effects\\nappear in region-level models such as Equation 31. In general, a wider dispersion of conditionsexperienced across locations and moments within a summarized region leads to greater smooth-\\ning and ﬂattening of the response in Equation 31 relative to the local instantaneous response\\n(Figure 5 c–e). Thus, we expect that larger and more heterogenous regions with longer periods of\\nobservation should produce smoother and ﬂatter responses to summary climate measures, even if\\nlocal nonlinear effects are unchanged.\\n4.1.3.

Displacement and Delay\\nIn many contexts, it is plausible that climatic events at moments in the past or at nearby locations\\naffect an outcome at a speciﬁc time and place, much like the surface of a pond observed at any\\nmoment and location might depend on whether a raindrop disturbed that location or a nearbypoint on the pond surface moments before. When using time-series identiﬁcation of climate\\neffects, it is crucial to account for these ripple effects so that a local transient response is not\\nmischaracterized as a persistent effect. Of particular concern is whether climatic events have a neteffect on outcomes, or whether they simply displace outcomes across time and/or space.\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 63 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nAll-cause daily male mortality rate\\nfollowing temperature exposure \\n(per 100,000 individuals)\\nGDP loss surrounding cyclone \\nexposure after 15 years\\n  (% per meter per second)ab\\n00 –\\n400400–\\n800800–\\n1,2001,200–\\n1,6001,600–\\n2,000–0.8–0.6–0.4–0.200.20.40.6\\n–0.020.00\\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30Effect of neighbor’s exposure\\nEffect of own \\ncyclone exposure0.020.040.060.080.10\\nDays after temperature exposureDistance from exposed country (km)Effect of day with mean temperature <30°FEffect of day with mean temperature >80°F\\nFigure 7\\n(a) Temporal lag effects of hot and cold days on all causes of male mortality based on data from Desch ˆenes & Moretti (2009).

Adapted from Hsiang & Jina (2014).\\nThus far, we have only considered contemporaneous effects of the vector ciτon outcome Yiτ.\\nWe now consider the inﬂuence of the entire vector ﬁeld c(s,t) deﬁned across all positions sand\\nmoments ton the outcome Yiτ.\\n4.2.1. Temporal displacement. A climatic event at time tmight bring an event that would\\notherwise occur at time t+1 forward in time, an effect known as temporal displacement or\\nharvesting. For example, Desch ˆenes & Moretti (2009) highlight the importance of this concept by\\ndemonstrating that many deaths that occur during hot days in the United States would have likelyoccurred within the subsequent two months even in the absence of a hot day; they thus conclude\\nthat an effect of a heat wave will inﬂuence the timing of deaths within a relatively narrow window,\\nin addition to creating some entirely new deaths ( Figure 7 a). Mathematically, the signature of\\ntemporal displacement is for periods following a climatic event to have a response that is opposite\\nin sign to the contemporaneous response. A challenge to identifying these lagged effects is that\\nthe climatic histories of sequential moments overlap, so it may not be the case that outcomes atany moment are only a response to a single historical climate event. Rather, outcomes at each\\nmoment represent a superposition of many historical events each at a different moment in time.\\nThis issue can be resolved by conditioning expected outcomes on the complete history of climaticevents using a distributed lag model:\\nY\\niτ=ˆαi+L/summationdisplay\\nl=0/parenleftBig\\nci,τ−lˆβl/parenrightBig\\n+xiτˆγ+ˆθ(i)(τ)+ˆ/epsilon1iτ, (33)\\nwhere lis a lag length measured in periods ( l=0 indicates a contemporaneous observation),\\nand the maximum lag length considered is L. The identifying assumption to this approach is\\nthat the inﬂuence of a climate event at τ0on outcomes at τ1is determined by the length of\\ntimeτ1−τ0separating the observations. As written, this model also assumes additive separability\\nbetween lagged effects, although this assumption can be relaxed by interacting lagged terms. It issomewhat standard in the literature to sometimes include negative lags (leads) in Equation 33 as a\\n64 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nfalsiﬁcation exercise, as it is generally assumed that future climatic events do not affect outcomes\\nsubstantially.\\nThe net effect of a one-unit climatic event after λperiods is the cumulative effect\\nˆ/Omega1λ=λ/summationdisplay\\nl=0ˆβl. (34)\\nIf all of the effects of a climate event displace outcomes in time, then ˆ/Omega1λ=Lwill be zero, whereas\\na positive or negative cumulative effect indicates that climatic events caused additional changesbeyond altering the timing of events. It is worth noting that when the outcome is a growth rate,\\nthen these cumulative effects represent changes in levels, as explored and discussed by Dell et al.\\n(2012) and Hsiang & Jina (2014). Burke et al. (2015c) compute /Omega1\\nλin a nonlinear context.\\n4.2.2. Delayed effects. Equation 33 is also used to detect delayed effects, which may arise even if\\ncontemporaneous effects ( ˆβl=0) are small or zero but lagged effects ( ˆβl>0) are large. In several cases,\\nsuch as the effect of cold days on mortality ( Figure 7 a)( D e s c h ˆenes & Moretti 2009) or the effect of\\ntropical cyclones on employment and income (Anttila-Hughes & Hsiang 2012, Deryugina 2015),\\ndelayed effects are of ﬁrst-order relevance, dominating contemporaneous effects.\\n4.2.3. Spatial displacement and remote effects. Similar to temporal displacement and delay,\\nit is possible that climatic events cause outcomes to be displaced across space or trigger remote\\noutcomes (analogous to delayed effects in space) even if local effects are limited, perhaps because\\nmarkets and price signals efﬁciently transmit the inﬂuence of the climate across locations. Forexample, Hsiang & Jina (2014) examine whether cyclone strikes displace income growth to nearby\\ncountries ( Figure 7 b). The econometric challenge associated with identifying these effects is\\nanalogous to the temporal case, as overlapping spatial effects may complicate the spatial distributionof outcomes, similar to multiple simultaneous raindrops generating overlapping rings of waves\\nin a pond. The solution is also similar and involves estimating a spatial lag model analogous to\\nEquation 33, but where lags are applied to the index i, rather than τ, based on the distance between\\ncontemporaneous observations; effects at all distances are estimated simultaneously. Similar to\\ntemporal lags, the net effect of a climatic event can be considered by summing lags, although\\ncare must be taken because the number of observations at varying distances may not necessarily beconstrained and will depend on the spatial arrangement of units. This approach performs especially\\nwell when it is applied to data on a regular grid, as demonstrated by Harari & La Ferrara (2013).\\nIn cases where remote effects may be delayed, then a model with spatial-temporal lags is required:\\nY\\niτ=ˆαi+L/summationdisplay\\nl=0/Pi1/summationdisplay\\nπ=0{c[j|D(i,j)=π],τ−lˆβlπ}+xiτˆγ+ˆθ(i)(τ)+ˆ/epsilon1i, (35)\\nwhere c[j|D(i,j)=π],τ−lis the average climate exposure of all locations jthat are at a distance πfrom\\nlocation i(where the outcome is observed) at time τ−l.D(i,j) is the distance from itoj.F o r\\nexample, Figure 7 bdisplays the cumulative growth effect of a cyclone as a function of distance\\nfrom the event.\\n4.3. Statistical Uncertainty\\nUncertainty estimates for regressions must account for the strong spatial and temporal autocor-relation in climatic exposure, regardless of the research design employed. The concern is that\\nunobservable omitted variables may also be autocorrelated, such that spurious correlations withclimate events occur with greater frequency than they would if all observations were independently\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 65 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\ndistributed—this will cause bias in estimates of standard errors even though estimated climate ef-\\nfects ˆβmay be unbiased (Bertrand et al. 2004, Moulton 1986). The extent of the bias in standard\\nerrors depends on the spatial scale and sampling frequency of the data relative to natural patterns\\nof autocorrelation in the climatic variations of interest. Data that are aggregated to large scales\\nare generally less problematic, and different solutions come at different computational cost andmay be appropriate in different contexts. Schlenker & Roberts (2009) propose applying Conley\\nspatial standard errors (Conley 1999) that nonparametrically estimate the variance-covariance\\nmatrix of βby estimating cov( /epsilon1\\ni,τ,/epsilon1j,τ)u s i n g ξ[D(i,j)]ˆ/epsilon1i,τˆ/epsilon1j,τ,w h e r e ξ[D(i,j)] is a kernel function\\nthat weights these terms based on D(i,j), the distance between observations iandj. Hsiang (2010)\\ncombines this approach with Newey-West heteroskedastic6and auto-correlation robust (HAC)\\nstandard errors (Newey & West 1987) to also account for temporal autocorrelation within panel\\nunits. Hsiang & Jina (2014) demonstrate that this spatial-HAC adjustment was correctly sized in\\none context by estimating pseudoexact p-values via randomizing their data in multiple dimensions\\nand reestimating their model many times. Fetzer (2014) expands this approach to an instrumental\\nvariables context.\\nThe spatial-HAC approach is computationally intensive, as distances between every pair of\\nobservations must be computed and transformed, and it does not guarantee a positive-deﬁnite\\nestimate for the covariance matrix of residuals. Thus, it may often be reasonable to estimate\\napproximate standard errors using simpler techniques, verifying that spatial-HAC adjustmentsdo not alter the result substantively. For example, Dell et al. (2012) simply cluster their standard\\nerrors within panel units to account for temporal autocorrelation. Burke & Emerick (2016) cluster\\nstandard errors for county-level observations in a long-differences model by state to account forwithin-state spatial correlation; cross-state residual correlations in errors are assumed to be small\\nafter conditioning on state ﬁxed effects. Hsiang et al. (2013) employ a block bootstrap in a fully\\nnonparametric regression and block-resample entire cross sections of a panel data set to account for\\nspatial autocorrelation among contemporary observations. Hsiang et al. (2011) collapse a global\\npanel to a single time series when examining ENSO effects, as the treatment generates spatialcorrelations at continental (or larger) scales.\\nIt remains an open question what the most general and efﬁcient approach to estimating statis-\\ntical uncertainty is in most climate econometrics applications. For example, what is the optimalselection of kernel-weighting functions for contemporaneous and serial observations in the spatial-\\nHAC approach? Also, many climate data sets are derived from gridded data, which themselves\\nmight be spatially interpolated from station data or augmented with a physics-based model—suchas reanalysis products (Auffhammer et al. 2013)—and it remains unknown how these procedures\\ninﬂuence the statistical uncertainty of resulting parameter estimates.\\n4.4. Adaptation\\nAs discussed above, climate affects economic outcomes through belief effects and direct effects,\\nand it is generally thought that most belief effects are adjustments that individuals make to cope\\nwith their expected distribution of direct effects. For this reason, belief effects are often described\\nas adaptations to a climate, although this need not always be true (e.g., beliefs about the climatecould serve simply as a coordinating mechanism). In this framework, adaptations can be deﬁned\\nas belief effects that interact with direct effects; for example, some agents believe it will be cold\\nsometimes at a location, causing them to purchase coats (a belief effect), which reduces the chance\\n6Note that the Conley approach employed by Schlenker & Roberts (2009) was also robust to heteroskedasticity.\\n66 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nthey become ill after cold days (a direct effect). Multiple approaches have been used to document\\nand quantify these adaptations.\\n4.4.1. Indirect measurement via a cross section of levels. One strategy for measuring the\\ninﬂuence of adaptations is to estimate the effect of climate on some outcome that is inﬂuencedby adaptation using a cross-sectional research design (Equation 8). The central beneﬁt of this\\napproach is that it captures all belief effects, including adaptations that interact with direct effects\\nof the climate. For example, farm prices in Mendelsohn et al. (1994) should reﬂect any effects\\nthat beliefs over Chave, including the net present value of all future revenues that result from\\nrealizations of c, which are mediated by these beliefs and the resulting management practices.\\nThere are two weaknesses to measuring adaptations using this approach: Measurement relies on\\nthe strongest form of the unit homogeneity assumption (Equation 6), and the cross-sectional\\napproach cannot separately disentangle belief effects that do not interact with direct effects, beliefeffects that do, and the integrated effect of all direct effects. However, an approach proposed by\\nMoore & Lobell (2014) combines this approach with time-series identiﬁcation in an effort to\\npartially isolate these effects from one another.\\n4.4.2. Explicit observation of adaptation. Another approach to documenting adaptations is to\\nestimate the effect of climate directly on outcomes that are known (or thought) to be adaptationsto climate. For example, Hornbeck (2012) and Hidalgo et al. (2010) estimate the effect of drought\\non migration of agricultural households, and Kurukulasuriya & Mendelsohn (2008) measure how\\nclimate inﬂuences the selection of crops that farmers choose to plant. This approach can be adoptedin a cross-section, times-series, or long-differences framework. A beneﬁt is that the adaptive action\\nis known and observed directly, rather than indirectly. However, a limitation is that this approach\\ndoes not recover the overall effectiveness of these adaptations, i.e., the extent to which the altered\\nactions interact with direct effects of climate.\\n4.4.3. Measurement of implicit adaptation combining time-series variation with stratiﬁ-\\ncation. The one approach able to isolate the effectiveness of adaptations is to use a time-series\\nresearch design (Equation 10) for an outcome affected by adaptation, stratifying the sample—orestimating interactions—using variables that are thought to predict the extent of adaptation. For\\nexample, Auffhammer & Aroonruengsawat (2011) estimate the effect of daily temperature on en-\\nergy consumption while stratifying by long-run average temperatures, demonstrating that energydemand is higher on hot days in counties that are usually hotter on average. This result suggests that\\nthe adoption of air conditioning, which is unobserved but assumed to be higher in counties that are\\nhotter on average, increases the effect of temperature on electricity demand. Roberts & Schlenker(2011) effectively stratify a panel of counties by year, implemented by interacting a response func-\\ntion with a nonlinear trend, to understand if innovation over time or learning reduced the heat\\nsensitivity of maize in Indiana [Lobell et al. (2014) ask a similar question by examining how cross-sectional estimates of climatic effects on yields evolve over a sequence of years]. Hsiang & Narita\\n(2012) derive a theory describing when such stratiﬁcation works to reveal the total effectiveness of\\nadaptations. According to these authors, a beneﬁt of this approach is its ability to measure the over-\\nall net effectiveness of all adaptive actions that project onto the interacted proxy variables, whereas\\na weakness is that the costs of indirectly observed adaptations are unknown. To partially addressthis weakness, Schlenker et al. (2013) propose an approach to measure adaptation costs in terms of\\nthe outcome variable, although it is possible that additional costs or beneﬁts may be unobserved.\\nAnother key challenge of this approach is that those measures used as correlates for adaptations,\\nsuch as income (Hsiang & Narita 2012), urban status (Burgess et al. 2014), historical experience\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 67 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nwith climatic events (Hsiang & Jina 2014), or access to crop insurance (Annan & Schlenker 2015)\\nare not exogenous and vary primarily in cross section. This means it may be difﬁcult to determinewhether changes to the measured variable are a cause of adaptation, an effect of adaptation, or\\ndriven by an omitted variable that determines both. This drawback can be partially solved in cases\\nwhere plausibly exogenous circumstances change an inﬂuential factor, enabling a researcher tomore credibly identify whether a speciﬁc factor constrains adaptation. This approach is applied by\\nHornbeck & Keskin (2015) to estimate the effect of groundwater discovery on agricultural adap-\\ntation and by Barreca et al. (2013) to estimate the effect of residential air conditioning technology\\non health-related adaptation.\\n4.5. Comparisons and Synthesis of Results Across Studies\\nUnlike many other econometric studies, such as those that study policy changes, regressors in cli-\\nmate econometric studies are generally physical quantities that have similar or identical meaning\\nat all times and at any location on the planet. Because of this, comparisons across contexts are\\nthought to have clearer interpretations, often demonstrating replicability or highlighting impor-tant differences across samples. For example, Hsiang & Narita (2012) and Hsiang & Jina (2014)\\ndemonstrate notable global uniformity in the response to cyclones. In some cases, such as Guo\\net al. (2014) examining mortality and Hsiang et al. (2013) examining social conﬂict, standardizationofcto a z-score based on historical variance brings parameter estimates into alignment—perhaps\\nbecause populations form beliefs and adapt effectively to distributions of historical conditions.\\nIn some sectors, notably agricultural impacts and climatic effects on social conﬂict, explicit\\ncomparisons of seemingly contradictory ﬁndings have generated substantial controversy. In the\\ncase of agriculture, much of this disagreement can be reconciled by accounting for inconsistent\\naggregation of data in the presence of local nonlinearities (see Section 4.1). In the case of social\\nconﬂict, much of this disagreement can be reconciled by accounting for statistical uncertainty in\\nparameter estimates (Hsiang & Meng 2014, Hsiang et al. 2015).\\nHierarchical meta-analysis has played a role in synthesizing generalizable ﬁndings and quan-\\ntifying the extent of agreement in the literature (Hsiang et al. 2013) as well as in constructing\\ncomposite estimates for use in the climate projections discussed below (Houser et al. 2015). Theseapproaches do not assume globally uniform effects but instead model parameter estimates from the\\nliterature in a random-effects framework, where populations experience different true effects of\\nthe climate but may exhibit a generalizable component that is common across populations (Burkeet al. 2015b, Gelman et al. 2004).\\n5. ATTRIBUTION AND PROJECTION\\nTwo objectives of understanding the effect of climate on societies are to understand what ele-ments of the modern world might be attributable to climatic factors and to inform projections offuture outcomes under different climate scenarios. Both are cases in which parameters recovered\\nempirically are put to work. Note that in the following, I retain only the time index for simplicity.\\n5.1. Historical Attribution\\nHaving identiﬁed the effect of current and previous climatic conditions Con outcome Y,i ti s\\nnatural to ask, what counterfactual outcomes would we have observed historically under a different\\nclimate? In our one realization of history, we observed YtandCtand estimated a response surface\\nˆf(C) that described deviations from some benchmark outcome Y0associated with the benchmark\\n68 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nclimate C0. In estimation, these benchmark levels are usually nuisance parameters absorbed by\\nvarious ﬁxed effects, trends, and controls. Observed outcomes are then\\nYt=Y0+ˆf(Ct)−ˆf(C0), (36)\\nwhere Y0can be solved for but is not observed. Writing an analogous equation for an arbitrary\\ncounterfactual climate Ct+/Delta1Ctand an associated unknown counterfactual outcome Yt+/Delta1Yt,\\nwe difference these equations to obtain\\n/Delta1ˆYt=ˆf(Ct+/Delta1Ct)−ˆf(Ct), (37)\\nwhich allows us to estimate /Delta1ˆYt, the alteration of an outcome that we would expect due to a\\nchange in historical climate by /Delta1Ct. This approach was used by Lobell et al. (2011) to estimate\\nthe historical effect of observed warming on global crop yields, by Hsiang et al. (2011) to estimate\\nthe historical inﬂuence of ENSO on global conﬂict, by Hsiang & Jina (2014) to estimate historicalinﬂuence of tropical cyclones on national income trajectories, and by Carleton & Hsiang (2016)\\nto attribute impacts based on a variety of results from the literature. Importantly, these estimates\\nshould be viewed as partial equilibrium estimates insofar as ˆf(.) captures a partial equilibrium re-\\nsponse. Costinot et al. (2016) and Desmet & Rossi-Hansberg (2015) demonstrate more structured\\napproaches that can be used to attribute historical impacts in a general equilibrium framework.\\nApplication of Equation 37 must be implemented cautiously, as counterfactual outcomes are\\nnot observed and thus cannot be veriﬁed. One indirect test of this approach, useful when ˆf(.)i s\\nidentiﬁed via time-series variation, is to examine how closely predictions from Equation 37 match\\nhistorical cross-sectional patterns. Dell et al. (2009) run such a test for effects of temperatureon income, arguing that adaptation and growth convergence must explain the difference. Graff\\nZivin et al. (2015) arrive at similar conclusions when comparing time-series estimates with long\\ndifferences in measures of human capital. Hsiang & Jina (2015) compare predictions based on\\nmicrolevel estimates with macrolevel cross sections for tropical cyclone impacts and conclude\\nthat results are largely consistent. In a remarkable higher-order test, Barreca et al. (2015) ﬁnd thatcross-sectional variation in the intra-annual variance in temperature, when applied to Equation 37,\\nis a good predictor of cross-sectional patterns of intra-annual variance in birth rates.\\n5.2. Projecting Future Effects of Climate Changes\\nProjecting impacts of climate changes is analogous to applying Equation 37, except that Ctis\\nreplaced with a benchmark future scenario—usually a “no change” scenario based on historical\\ndistributions of variables—and /Delta1Ctis an anthropogenic alteration to the climate. Early economic\\nanalyses used simple, spatially uniform, general estimates of /Delta1Ct, such as imposing a ﬂat +5◦F\\nwarming and +8% rainfall across the United States (Mendelsohn et al. 1994). In the econometrics\\nliterature, Schlenker et al. (2006) and Desch ˆenes & Greenstone (2007) introduce the use of spatially\\nand temporally resolved global climate model simulations to construct /Delta1Ct. Lobell et al. (2008)\\nand Burke et al. (2009) demonstrate that when applying climate model projections in Equation 37,\\naccounting for climate model uncertainty in /Delta1Ctmay be as important as accounting for statistical\\nuncertainty in ˆf(.) See Burke et al. (2015a) for additional exploration of this issue.\\nThe above approaches generally assume that ˆf(.) has a ﬁxed structure throughout the duration\\nof the projection simulation, perhaps a reasonable assumption in cases where historical changes in\\nˆf(.) have been limited. However, as demonstrated in Section 2.4 (recall Figure 3 d), the marginal\\neffect of climate identiﬁed via weather and captured in ˆf(.) may become increasingly incorrect\\nas climatic conditions deviate from baseline conditions during a projection simulation and theseadaptations [or other factors, such as those described in Lobell et al. (2014)] alter ˆf(.). To partially\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 69 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\naddress this issue, Houser et al. (2015) demonstrate how multiple empirical estimates, capturing\\nboth cross-sectional heterogeneity and trends in ˆf(.), could be combined to construct projections\\nwhere ˆf(.) evolves throughout the projection simulation to reﬂect historical patterns and rates of\\nadaptation.\\n5.2.1. Top-down and bottom-up approaches. Optimal climate policy requires understanding\\nthe full economic burden of potential climate trajectories. Empirical estimates can be used to gen-\\nerate projections of this total cost using either a top-down estimate, where the modeled outcome\\nYtis some aggregate proxy for well-being, such as GDP (Burke et al. 2015c, Dell et al. 2012,\\nDeryugina & Hsiang 2014, Nordhaus 2006), or constructing bottom-up estimates for multipleoutcomes representing different sectors of the economy that are modeled and summed, sometimes\\ncalled the enumerative approach (Houser et al. 2015, Tol 2002). In principle, both approaches\\ncan be comprehensive, so long as top-down estimates are augmented with nonmarket impacts. Inpractice, bottom-up estimates may better account for the distributional costs of climate change\\n(Houser et al. 2015), although it is theoretically possible for them to perform equally well. When\\napplying Equation 37 to bottom-up projections, it is important to account for the covariance ofimpacts across different sectors to accurately construct the distribution of aggregate losses (Houser\\net al. 2015), an effect that is thought to be mostly captured in the estimated responses used for\\ntop-down projections.\\n6. REMAINING CHALLENGES\\nIn addition to challenges described in the sections above, there are four major areas where I see\\nmethodological innovation as necessary and likely to be successful in the near future.\\n6.1. Matching Effects and Mechanisms\\nRegardless of the research design, most estimated effects of climate are reduced from estimatesthat capture inﬂuences on an outcome through all possible pathways. Developing strategies and\\ntechniques that can isolate and characterize a speciﬁc mechanism is critical for understandingwhy climatic factors matter. Testing for interactions with potential mediating factors that are\\nplausibly exogenous (Barreca et al. 2013), exploiting natural experiments where speciﬁc pathways\\nare shut down (Fetzer 2014), and matching detailed patterns of climate inﬂuence on outcomes andpotential mediating factors (Anttila-Hughes & Hsiang 2012) are all approaches that have been\\nsomewhat successful in speciﬁc contexts, although additional innovations in this area are needed,\\nas these strategies are not always available.\\n6.2. Adaptation and General Equilibrium\\nAs discussed above, adaptation to climate is thought to be economically important, but it has only\\nbeen characterized in a limited number of cases. Notably, the costs of adaptations are almost never\\nmeasured because they are usually not observed. Moreover, most measurements are partial equi-\\nlibrium responses, whereas general equilibrium responses to climate, such as factor reallocations\\nacross space or time, are a form of adaptation thought to be important but about which little isknown. Further, general equilibrium changes will result in changing prices, and knowing these\\nadjustments is important for valuing quantity effects that are already understood. However, only\\na small number of studies have begun exploring these effects (Colmer 2016, Costinot et al. 2016,Roberts & Schlenker 2013).\\n70 Hsiang RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\n6.3. Unprecedented Events\\nIn analyses of future climate changes, evaluating events that are unprecedented in recent history\\nis a major obstacle, and any empirical progress on these questions would be highly valuable.\\nInnovative strategies that can measure potential costs of unprecedented physical events, such asrapid sea level rise or ocean acidiﬁcation, or that characterize the likelihoods of unprecedented\\nsocial responses to climatic changes, such as mass migrations or state failures, are needed if these\\nimpacts are to be accounted for systematically in assessment exercises.\\n6.4. Integration with Theory and Numerical Models\\nNumerous theoretical models, including many used for integrated assessment policy analysis,have elements that describe climatic inﬂuence on economies (Nordhaus 1993, Stern 2006, Tol2002) but are generally not based on empirically derived relationships. Incorporation of empirical\\nparameter estimates into process models (Houser et al. 2015, Lobell et al. 2013) and integrated\\nassessment models (Kopp et al. 2013, Moore & Diaz 2015) demonstrates promise, although muchinnovation is needed if these theoretical models are to perform as well as analogous models in other\\nscientiﬁc ﬁelds. For example, it is unknown if empirical calibration improves the out-of-sample\\nforecast performance of these models or if all model parameters are even theoretically estimable\\nusing existing techniques.\\n7. CONCLUSION\\nRecent years have seen rapid innovation in the methods used to identify climatic inﬂuences on\\neconomies, with correspondingly rapid growth of insights that are reshaping how we understandthe breadth and importance of climate–society interactions (Carleton & Hsiang 2016, Dell et al.\\n2014). Key innovations have been in research design, the measurement of climatic factors, and\\nthe formulation of econometric models. In sharp contrast to the folk wisdom that “climate is notweather,” here I demonstrate that under fairly general conditions, weather variation, as it is used in\\nmany recent studies, exactly identiﬁes the effect of climate—although many studies to date have not\\nproperly computed the effect of climatic changes when using these weather-derived parameters.Aggregation and synthesis of econometric ﬁndings have demonstrated a striking replicability of\\nmany recent ﬁndings across contexts, lending credibility both to the techniques that generate\\nthese results and to exercises where these results are applied to simulations of recent history or\\nfuture climate changes. Many ﬁrst-order partial equilibrium results are now well understood, yet\\nmajor methodological innovations are still required to ( a) tackle the key challenges of identifying\\nmechanisms, ( b) measure adaptation costs, general equilibrium, and price responses, ( c) evaluate\\nthe effects of unprecedented events, and ( d) more deeply integrate with theoretical and numerical\\npolicy models.\\nDISCLOSURE STATEMENT\\nThe author is not aware of any afﬁliations, memberships, funding, or ﬁnancial holdings that might\\nbe perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nI thank David Anthoff, Jesse Anttila-Hughes, Max Auffhammer, Alan Barrecca, Marshall Burke,\\nTamma Carleton, Olivier Desch ˆenes, Tatyana Deryugina, Ram Fishman, Michael Greenstone,\\nwww.annualreviews.org •Climate Econometrics 71 RE08CH04-Hsiang ARI 2 September 2016 8:33\\nMichael Hanemann, Wu-Teh Hsiang, Bob Kopp, David Lobell, Gordon McCord, Kyle Meng,\\nBilly Pizer, James Rising, Michael Roberts, Wolfram Schlenker, Christian Traeger, and seminarparticipants at Berkeley and Harvard for discussions and suggestions.
